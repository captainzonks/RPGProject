## RPG Project

Personal project to create an RPG text game. Eventual goals may be to put this to some graphical engine, Unity or Unreal, but for now it's just a little D&D-inspired text adventure.

### What's it do?

This branch is the current active development branch.

The basic functions of character creation are now implemented and functioning. Everything is working through a state engine, singleton and builder patterns, and the messy spaghetti of the previous code is now abstracted out into interfaces and decoupled classes and functions. A LOT smoother. A LOT of work still to do.

But it runs. For now.

I'm keeping the crap below in case I ever want to know how to format this readme... but this is the end.
