## RPG Project

Personal project to create an RPG text game. Eventual goals may be to put this to some graphical engine, Unity or Unreal, but for now it's just a little D&D-inspired text adventure.

### What's it do?

This branch is the current active development branch. I'm currently rewriting all the code to better decouple classes and functions. It was becoming spaghetti.

I'm keeping the crap below in case I ever want to know how to format this readme... but this is the end.
